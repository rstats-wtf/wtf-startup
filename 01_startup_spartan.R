#' Working with the .Renviron file

## We will be generating a Github Personal Access Token (PAT), adding it to
## your .Renviron file, creating a new project, commiting it with git and then
## using our PAT to uploading it to GitHub.

## functions from the `usethis` package will be very useful for this.
